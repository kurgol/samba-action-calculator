This repository is for the iOS version of Samba Action Calculator, based on the original [Samba Action Calculator tool by Elyoukey](http://elyoukey.com/sac/) and the initial code drop was donated by David Dawnay which consists of his [previous iOS version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/samba-action-calculator/id574482173?ls=1&mt=8).

Initially, the intention is to get the tool resubmitted to the app store so that it's available again - requires updating to 64 bit, changing min target to Xcode 8, min iOS target 8 (from 5.5.1). The current project dumps a ton of errors in Xcode and obviously Apple's minimum requirements for iOS apps has changed significantly.

Longer-term goals include refactoring the interface to make it more easy to use and generally modernizing the app.
